    <summary>Apprenti Geometre is an interactive software designed as an aid to teaching mathematics.</summary>
    <description>It was produced following research carried out by a team of CREM researchers, at the request of the Ministry of the French Community of Belgium.

It is a software that allows, among other things, to draw, cut, merge and move figures either intuitively or with the tools for transforming the plan.

This makes it available for all kinds of geometric or other activities (magnitudes, fractions, measurements…).
It is a field of experimentation that complements other more traditional ones, such as folding, cutting, manipulation of mirrors, instrument drawing, etc.
